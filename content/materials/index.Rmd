# Course Material

## Weeks 1-2

The first section of the class provides an introduction to data visualisation in R using the ggplot2 package. It is also assumed to be the *first* contact a student has with R, so it covers a lot of the introductory topics like "what is an R commmand?", "how do I write a script?" and so on. It is designed so that you can do it without me: open up the slides and the RStudio Cloud project (both linked below) and then watch the YouTube videos; these will direct you to various hands on exercises you can do within the RStudio Cloud project.

## Week 3

The next part of the class is a bridging section. It introduces a data set (the reasoning data) that I'll use later in the class, discusses reading data from and writing data to a CSV file, and introduces the pipe. Much of this section is devoted to a discussion of calculating "grouped summaries".

## Weeks 4-5

The third section in the class provides an introduction to data wrangling in R, mostly focusing on dplyr. Topics covered include: extracting a subset of the data, rearranging the data, computing new variables in a data set, merging multiple data sets, and pivoting data between "long" and "wide" forms.
